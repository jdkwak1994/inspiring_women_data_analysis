## Project Description
**Step 1: Web Scraping and Cleaning Data**
- Using tools such as `Beautiful Soup` and `Jupyter Notebook` to scrape and organize datas from [World Athletics](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/by-category/world-records) and [Woman CSV Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-12-08).
- Store the data to local `MongoDB` server.

**Step 2: HTML/CSS/JS**
- Develop `index.html` as main page that will connect to various visualizations like maps, plots, and timeline.
- Main page utilizes `amcharts` wordcloud that displays most commonly found words in inspiring women descriptions.
